To download the main track instances (which I've not included here):
* Download [this](https://satcompetition.github.io/2021/downloads/main2021.url)
* Run
    ```sh
    wget --content-disposition -i main2021.url
    ```
wherever you want them to be downloaded (Remember their size is around 1.1GB)

Their benchmarks are in `r_main.csv`
